<p>Contents: PCA of the sliding window video embedding of a video of healthy vibrating vocal folds, synchronized with the video.  This is an example of a periodic process which is loop-like in the embedding. </p>

<p>Justification: Videos are difficult to convey in text </p>

<p>Contents: PCA of the sliding window video embedding of a video of vocal folds undergoing biphonation, synchronized with the video.  This is an example of a quasiperiodic process whose embedding lies on the torus. </p>

<p>Contents: PCA of the sliding window video embedding of a video of vocal folds undergoing irregular vibration, synchronized with the video.  This is an example of a process which is neither periodic nor quasiperiodic. </p>

<p>Type: Web pages with tables and videos</p>

<p>Contents: TDA rankings contains a table of videos ranked in decreasing order of periodicity, as scored by our sliding window embedding 1-persistence scheme, along with alternative features for periodicity scoring (lattice score, "clarity score").  Turk Rankings contains a table of videos ranked in decreasing order of periodicity, as scored by the scalar ranking function <b>s</b> resulting from Hodge rank aggregation of pairwise rankings from Amazon Mechanical Turk users.</p>

<p>Justification: So that the experimental videos and results of the video rankings can be viewed in greater detail, and so that the results of Hodge Rank aggregation from the mechanical turk users can be viewed in greater detail and visually compared to the TDA rankings</p>
